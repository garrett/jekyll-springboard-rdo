# Fedora 20 with existing network

(Originally posted at <https://ask.openstack.org/en/question/24719/how-to-install-packstack-allinone-on-fedora-20-with-an-existing-external-network/> )

Goal: install a working openstack allinone deployment on Fedora 20 with an existing external network

Environment: This machine is at home which means that it uses DHCP to acquire a local address from my router. The router is the DHCP and DNS server for the home network. My machine gets the address 192.168.1.4 and the router is 192.168.1.1. I am running Fedora 20. My installation automatically created em1 (not eth0).

    yum -y update

    # enable sshd
    systemctl enable sshd
    systemctl start sshd

    # enable zfs-fuse
    yum -y install zfs-fuse
    systemctl enable zfs-fuse
    systemctl start zfs-fuse

    # do initial setup of openvswitch

    # this is following "openstack packstack installation with external connectivity"
    # (http://allthingsopen.com/2013/08/23/openstack-packstack-installation-with-external-connectivity/)

    yum -y install openvswitch

    # Make /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br-ex resemble this:

    cat <<EOF >/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br-ex
    DEVICE=br-ex
    OVSBOOTPROTO=dhcp
    OVSDHCPINTERFACES=em1
    NM_CONTROLLED=no
    ONBOOT=yes
    TYPE=OVSBridge
    DEVICETYPE=ovs
    EOF

    # Make /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-em1 resemble this (but change the HWADDR and UUID to match what is currently in ifcfg-em1

    cat <<EOF >/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-em1
    DEVICE="em1"
    HWADDR="BC:AE:C5:74:97:11"
    UUID="dd86d0fb-dedf-4fd8-be7c-f99b19dbfe0d"
    TYPE="OVSPort"
    DEVICETYPE="ovs"
    OVS_BRIDGE="br-ex"
    ONBOOT="yes"
    NM_CONTROLLED="no"
    EOF

    # stop using NetworkManager, start using network

    systemctl stop NetworkManager
    systemctl disable NetworkManager

    systemctl enable network

    reboot

    # once we are back from the reboot, verify that we still have network connectivity:

    curl rdoproject.org/QuickStart

    # at this point, 'ovs-vsctl show' looks like:

    ovs-vsctl show

        Bridge br-ex
            Port "em1"
                Interface "em1"
            Port br-ex
                Interface br-ex
                    type: internal
        ovs_version: "2.0.0"

    # install packstack (but don't run it yet)

    yum -y install openstack-packstack

    # (from the allthingsopen site)
    # "Edit /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/packstack/puppet/modules/openstack/manifests/provision.pp and change $floating_range to a range that is suitable for the network em1 is on.". As I stated previous, my network is a local network behind the router. I chose 192.168.1.192-192.168.1.222 for my floating_range

    sed -e "s/^  $floating_range            = .*$/  $floating_range            = '192.168.1.192\/27',/g" -i /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/packstack/puppet/modules/openstack/manifests/provision.pp

    # (again from the allthingsopen site)
    # "One last modification before we run packstack, and thanks to Terry Wilson for pointing this out, we need to remove a a firewall rule that is added during the packstack run that adds a NAT rule which will effectively block inbound traffic to a launched instance. You can edit /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/packstack/puppet/templates/provision.pp and comment out the following lines.

    # firewall { '000 nat':
    #   chain  =&gt; 'POSTROUTING',
    #   jump   =&gt; 'MASQUERADE',
    #   source =&gt; $::openstack:rovision::floating_range,
    #   outiface =&gt; $::gateway_device,
    #   table =&gt; 'nat',
    #   proto =&gt; 'all',
    # }

    # implement workarounds found in "Workarounds 2014 01" (http://rdoproject.org/Workarounds_2014_01)

    setenforce 0

    # I go further and disable selinux by editing /etc/selinux/config and setting
    # SELINUX=enforcing to SELINUX=permissive

    # I had real problems with my instances once I installed gnome on them. After much searching I figured out that I needed to change the cpu mode qemu uses. My cpu reports that it supports avx, but when kvm tries to emulate that instruction it crashes.

On July 9th, 11am Eastern time, Eoghan Glynn will be leading a hangout in which he'll discuss what's coming in Ceilometer in the Juno release. You can register to attend (so you'll get a reminder) and attend the actual event, at https://plus.google.com/events/c6e8vjjn8klrf78ruhkr95j4tas

If the time isn't convenient, you'll be able to watch the archived video at that same location afterwards.

Please come to the #rdo-hangout channel on the Freenode IRC network for discussion and questions during the event.

Ceilometer is the metering/monitoring component of OpenStack. You can read more about it at http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ceilometer/

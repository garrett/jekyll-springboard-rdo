Next week, Friday, September 5, 10 am Eastern US time, Lars Kellogg-Stedman will be presenting a Google Hangout on the subject of deploying with Heat. This will be streamed live on YouTube at https://plus.google.com/events/c9u4sjn7ksb8jrmma7vd25aok94 and if the time is not convenient, you will be able to watch it at that same URL after the fact.

Come to the #rdo-hangout channel on Freenode IRC for questions and discussion during and after the event, or come to #rdo at any time for RDO-related discussion.

What does RDO stand for?

![tshirt](/images/blog/rdo-tshirt.jpg)

The [RDO FAQ](/rdo/faq) has long said that RDO doesn't stand for
anything. This is a very unsatisfying answer to one of the most
frequently asked questions about RDO. So, a little while ago, I started
saying that RDO stands for "Rich's Distribution of OpenStack." Although
tongue-in-cheek, this response emphasizes that RDO is a community driven
project. So it's also Radez's Distribution of OpenStack, and Radhesh's and Russel's
and red\_trela's. (As well as lots of people whose names don't start with R!)

It also stands for "RPM Distribution of OpenStack." And "Really
Deploy OpenStack", and "Rebuilt Daily OpenStack", and a variety of other
things.

So, that's the thinking behind the tshirt that we're giving out at our booth at
OpenStack Summit here in Tokyo. We still have a few left, so drop by the Red
Hat booth and get yours while they last.

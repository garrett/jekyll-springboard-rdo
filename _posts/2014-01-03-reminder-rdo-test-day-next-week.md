Next week (January 7/8) we'll be doing our first Icehouse test day, and we'd appreciate it if you could help us out with an hour or two of your time.

Details on the test day can be found at http://rdoproject.org/RDO_test_day_January_2014 and a matrix of what we'd like to test is at http://rdoproject.org/TestedSetups_2014_01

For the live backchannel, please join the #rdo channel on the Freenode IRC network, where many of us will be all day to answer questions, help work through problems, and for just general chat.

Thanks for any time you can contribute to this testing effort, to help make RDO as solid as possible.

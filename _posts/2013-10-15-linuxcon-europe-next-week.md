Next week, many of the RDO community will be in Edinburgh, UK, for LinuxCon Europe. http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe  There's a lot of OpenStack content at the conference, and there's also several co-located events that have a lot of cloud-related content:

* CloudOpen - http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/cloudopen-europe
* KVM Forum - http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kvm-forum
* Gluster Workshop - http://www.gluster.org/2013/10/gluster-workshop-in-edinburgh-at-linuxcon-europe/

And, of course, there's also really cool events like the Automotive Linux Summit - http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/automotive-linux-summit-fall - where they have all sorts of sweet toys.

If you're planning to be there, please drop by and say hi. Some of us will be at the OpenStack booth, and others at the KVM and Gluster events. In particular, if you'd like to talk about how you're using OpenStack and RDO in your organization, I'd love to do some brief interviews for the RDO website.

See http://community.redhat.com/events/#LinuxCon%20Europe for some of the talks that will be given about RDO and related topics.

Hope to see you there!

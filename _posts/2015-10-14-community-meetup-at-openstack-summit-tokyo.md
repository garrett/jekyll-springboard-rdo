We'll be having an [RDO community meetup](http://sched.co/4MYy) during the upcoming OpenStack Summit in Tokyo. It will be during lunch time (12:45 - 14:00)  in Sakura Lower Level S-1 and S-2.

As at previous Summits, we'll be gathering to discuss progress during
the last six months, and plans for the future. Please add discussion items
to the [agenda](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-tokyo) that you'd like for us to talk about.

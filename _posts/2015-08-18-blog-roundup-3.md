Here's what RDO enthusiasts have been writing about over the past week.

If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!

**Flavio Percoco, PTL of the Zaqar project** by Rich Bowen

> Zaqar (formerly called Marconi) is the messaging service in OpenStack. I recently had an opportunity to interview Flavio Percoco, who is the PTL (Project Technical Lead) of that project, about what’s new in Kilo, and what’s coming in Liberty.

**Tokenless Keystone** by Adam Young

> Keystone Tokens are bearer tokens, and bearer tokens are vulnerable to replay attacks. What if we wanted to get rid of them?

**Upgrades are dying, don’t die with them**, by Maxime Payant-Chartier

> We live in a world that has changed the way it consumes applications. The last few years have seen a rapid rise in the adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Much of this can be attributed to the broad success of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is said to have grown revenue from $3.1B to $5B last year (Forbes). More and more people, enterprise customers included, are consuming applications and resources that require little to no maintenance. And any maintenance that does happen, now goes unnoticed by users. This leaves traditional software vendors contending to find a way to adapt their distribution models to make their software easier to consume. Lengthy, painful upgrades are no longer acceptable to users, forcing vendors to create a solution to this problem.

**The OpenStack Big Tent**, by Rich Bowen

> OpenStack is big and complicated. It’s composed of many moving parts, and it can be somewhat intimidating to figure out what all the bits do, what’s required, what’s optional, and how to put all the bits together.

**Provider external networks (in an appropriate amount of detail)** by Lars Kellogg-Stedman

> In Quantum in Too Much Detail, I discussed the architecture of a Neutron deployment in detail. Since that article was published, Neutron gained the ability to handle multiple external networks with a single L3 agent. While I wrote about that back in 2014, I covered the configuration side of it in much more detail than I discussed the underlying network architecture. This post addresses the architecture side.

**Logging configuration in OpenContrail** by Numan Siddique

> We know that all software components and services generate log files. These log files are vital in troubleshooting and debugging problems. If the log files are not managed properly then it can  be extremely  difficult to get a good look into them.

**Neutron in-tree integration tests** by Assaf Muller

> It’s time for OpenStack projects to take ownership of their quality. Introducing in-tree, whitebox multinode simulated integration testing. A lot of work went in over the last few months by a lot of people to make it happen.

**Dims talks about the Oslo project**, by Rich Bowen

> This is the second in what I hope is a long-running series of interviews with the various OpenStack PTLs (Project Technical Leads), in an effort to better understand what the various projects do, what's new in the Kilo release, and what we can expect in Liberty, and beyond.

**Performance and Scaling your Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Cloud** by Joe Talerico

> As OpenStack continues to grow into a mainstream Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform, the industry seeks to learn more about its performance and scalability for use in production environments. As recently captured in this blog, common questions that typically arise are: “Is my hardware vendor working with my software vendor?”, “How much hardware would I actually need?”, and “What are the best practices for scaling out my OpenStack environment?”

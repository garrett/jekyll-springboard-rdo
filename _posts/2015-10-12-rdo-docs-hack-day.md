We plan to have a documentation and website hack day on October 15th.
If you would like to participate, here's what you need to do:

1) Get a working copy of the website by forking [the Github repository](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/)

2) Look through the [open issues list](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues) and pick something to work on.

3) Show up on #rdo on the Freenode IRC network on Thursday, ready to get started.

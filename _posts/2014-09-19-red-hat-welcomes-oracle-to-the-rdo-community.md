It was with surprise and pleasure that we learned of Oracle's decision to base their [commercial OpenStack offering](https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/entry/technology_preview_of_icehouse_with) on the community-supported RDO distribution of OpenStack. (See their packstack-based deployment instructions [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/vm/ovm-linux-openstack-2202503.pdf).) We are always happy to see people use our distribution, on which we encourage people to build proof of concept or test deployments of OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux as well as those other derivative distros.

If you experience difficulties with Oracle OpenStack, we encourage you to drop by the [#RDO channel on Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rdo) for help in getting it working. The more people using OpenStack, the better, right?

Of course, when you are ready to move to production, we encourage you to move to our production-hardened, ecosystem-supported, enterprise-ready [Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_OpenStack_Platform/), to ensure the best OpenStack experience possible.

And, Oracle, we encourage you to send your fixes back upstream. We look forward to your participation in the RDO community.

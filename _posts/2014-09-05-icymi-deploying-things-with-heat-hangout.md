In case you missed it, this morning Lars gave a presentation on deploying things with OpenStack Heat.

You can watch that presentation at https://plus.google.com/events/c9u4sjn7ksb8jrmma7vd25aok94

The slides are available at http://oddbit.com/rdo-hangout-heat-intro/#/

The templates used in the presentation are at https://github.com/larsks/rdo-hangout-heat-intro/

If you have questions about the presentation, you can ask them on the Hangout page, or in the #RDO or #Heat channel, on the Freenode IRC network, or you can subscribe to the rdo-list mailing list at http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list

Many thanks to Lars for the work that he put into this.

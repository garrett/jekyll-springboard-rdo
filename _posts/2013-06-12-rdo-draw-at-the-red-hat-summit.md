Come by the RDO stand in the developer lounge at the Red Hat Summit this week and enter our draw for a chance to win a Nexus 4 phone. We are giving away two Nexus 4s  to two lucky attendees. Draws occur at 1:45 pm at the booth.

The first Nexus 4 phone has been won by Gerald Nazareth - congratulations to Gerald. Call by the booth to pick up your prize! There's still a chance to win, though - call by the RDO stand this evening from 5:30pm to 7:30pm or tomorrow (Thursday 12th) between 11:00am and 1:45pm to enter.

We're pleased to announce the availability of RDO packages for OpenStack Juno, for EL7 (RHEL7 and CentOS7) and Fedora 20.

Fedora 21 is still in development and running RDO Juno on Fedora 21 is not recommended at this time. A separate announcement will be made when RDO Juno on Fedora 21 is ready.

You can get started with RDO Juno via the process described in the Quickstart - http://rdoproject.org/Quickstart - and the various packages are available at https://rdo.fedorapeople.org/openstack-juno/

As always, if you have questions, you can bring them here, to the rdo-list mailing list, or to the IRC channel - #rdo on freenode.irc.net.

Thanks for being part of the RDO community!

Here's the blog posts that came out of the RDO community last two weeks. Last week, I was in Budapest at ApacheCon Europe, and so missed doing this post.

**Co-Existence of Containers and Virtualization Technologies**, by  Federico Simoncelli 

> Lately there has been a growing interest in Linux containers solutions such as Docker. Docker provides an open and standardized platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications.

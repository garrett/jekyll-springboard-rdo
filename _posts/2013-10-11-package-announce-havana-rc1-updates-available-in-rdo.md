that were already packaged in the RDO repos, can be seen at:

A couple of support package updates worth mentioning are:

python-oslo-config-1.2.0-0.5.a3
 which now supports a more logical separation of
 distribution specific config and user specific config.

selinux-policy-3.7.19-216
 which now supports the quantum -> neutron renaming
 performed within the Havana cycle.

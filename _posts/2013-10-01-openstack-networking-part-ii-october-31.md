We're delighted to announce that we'll be doing another presentation on OpenStack networking, at 12 Eastern ([time in your timezone](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20131031T1600)).

Brent Eagles (beagles in the forums and IRC) will be presenting the next step, to follow on from Dave's presentation on basic networking. He'll be covering topics such as GRE tunneling and VLANs, and other advanced topics that you'll need to know. He'll also have the assistance of other folks on the Red Hat OpenStack networking team, both for the presentation and for Q&A afterwards.

The event will be an online live streaming event, but will also be available as an archived YouTube video afterwards. The address of the streaming event will be posted here,  and on the [Google+ event page](https://plus.google.com/events/cfgnq5t8it7uvksrtpd00s2fcmg) closer to the event, and if you indicate your attendance at the Google+ page, you'll be notified of updates to the information.

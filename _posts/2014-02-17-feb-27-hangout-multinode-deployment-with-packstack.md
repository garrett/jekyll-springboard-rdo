On Thursday, February 27th, at 10am EST (That's http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20140227T1500 your timezone) Lars Kellogg-Stedman will be doing a walk-through of a multinode deployment with packstack. This will be a Google Hangout, and will be streamed live at http://tm3.org/rdohangout  (That's just a placeholder page for now, but will redirect to the stream when the event starts.) And for those that find this time inconvenient, we'll be recording the presentation so you can watch it later.

Back-channel chat, and questions, will be on the #rdo-hangout IRC channel on Freenode during the presentation.

Another edition of the [OpenStack Summit](http://openstack.org/summit) is coming up, this time in Tokyo. And, as usual, you have an opportunity to [influence which talks will be selected](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers) for the event.

Of course, we're biased, and there's some talks we'd like to draw to your attention, in the hopes that there will be more RDO content at Summit, and we can bring even more people into our community.

[**Dive into Zuul**, with Fabien Boucher](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/4700)

> The OpenStack development workflow is one of the many reasons for the cloud platform’s success, and learning how it works is essential to going farther with the OpenStack project. In this talk, we will highlight features of Zuul, the gating tool that was specifically designed to manage contributions to OpenStack, by giving simple use case examples. This talk can help an OpenStack contributor gain a better understanding of the gating system used for OpenStack and can also be valuable for those wanting to improve their existing Gerrit/Jenkins-based continuous integration (CI) platform.

[**Common OpenStack RPM packaging upstream**, with Dirk Müller, Haïkel Guémar, and Thomas Bechtold](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5083)

> Following a spark of discussion that started back at the last OpenStack Summit in Vancouver, RPM Packagers
from Red Hat and SUSE decided to just try coming up with common RPM packaging that works universally across
their distributions.
> Meeting again half a year later we're recapping on how the packaging efforts started and what has been achieved
so far and give an introduction for both new comers and existing Cloud Operators a way to join the effort.

[**CentOS loves OpenStack**, with Haïkel Guémar, Rich Bowen, and Thomas Oulevey](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5043)

> One year ago, CentOS introduced Special Interest Groups (SIGs) which are smaller groups focus on a small set of issues. The Cloud SIG is one focused into bringing Cloud Infrastructure on top of CentOS, and among this group, we aimed to make OpenStack a first-class citizen with CentOS.
> OpenStack distribution is not just about packaging but also integration with the underlying Operating System. We learnt a lot from this experience, and managed to make OpenStack fit within CentOS story. Bridging the OpenStack
upstream and the CentOS downstream communities, effectively.

[**TryStack.org: Free OpenStack for Planet Earth**, with Will Foster,  Dan Radez,  Will Gough, Ben Swartzlander, and Kambiz Aghaiepour](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/6324)

> The OpenStack Foundation and several generous corporate sponsors (including Red Hat, Dell, Cisco, and NetApp) have deployed TryStack.org, a free way for folks to learn more about OpenStack and its capabilities. TryStack is a production OpenStack instance, and the maintainers have learned a great deal about deployments, maintenance, upgrades, gotchas, and monitoring.

[**RDO: Continuously packaging OpenStack master**, with Francisco Javier Peña, Haïkel Guémar, and Derek Higgins](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/4669)

> Did you know that, right after the stable Kilo branches were created, you already had access to Liberty packages from the RDO community? RDO is continuously building packages from the master OpenStack branches, fixing them as needed and running integration tests.

[**RDO: How we package the cloudy monster**, with Jakub Ruzicka](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/4440)

> RDO is an open community dedicated to packaging OpenStack and providing high-quality RPM packages for supported distributions. And, because OpenStack is a huge project with lightning-fast development, there are many challenges in packaging it for slower-moving Linux distributions.

[**RDO Manager 101: OpenStack Deployment & Management**, with Guillaume Chenuet and  Alexandre Maumené](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5245)

> If you have deployed OpenStack before, than you know how platforms come with various degrees of complexity and features. As a DevOps, one of our first challenge is to setup a platform, then maintain it through regular bug & security updates, while ensuring there is no downtime for users (because hey, it's in production!).

[**Ambassador community report**, with a large panel of presenters](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5014)

> OpenStack Ambassadors connect the user groups to the Foundation. They help initialize the groups and guide them to grow. Ambassadors can give feedback about all the OpenStack community.

[**OpenStack OpenSource Cloud Management**, with John Hardy](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5119)

> ManageIQ is an Open Source Cloud Management Platform that brings together vendors for best of breed management within a single pane glass view interface. The project supports many vendors as pluggable providers; Open Stack has both Infrastructure and Cloud provider plugins available for ManageIQ.

[**Cache-as-a Service in OpenStack**, with Dan Lambright and Luis Pabón](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/4876)

> Web based applications can see improved response times using distributed object caches.  In this talk, you will learn how such applications can enjoy caching benefits when they move to OpenStack using our implementation of "Cache-as-a-Service". Our design goals have been elasticity, maintainability, transparency to applications, and chargeability to tenants. We will explore several designs we considered and their trade offs, including service VMs and special-purpose instances spun up within the tenant, and show how they can be orchestrated using OpenStack Heat. Our implementation exports memcache and REDIS interfaces.

[**Leveraging Procedural Knowledge - A Path From n00b to OpenStack Contributor**, with Rain Leander](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5880)

> On the road to senior developer, one has to learn multiple languages. This often seems like a series of massive obstacles wherein each new language resembles a new beginning. However, developers may often underestimate the extent to which procedural knowledge from one language transfers to a new language. In this talk, I will demonstrate that the process from support engineer to Django Girls workshop participant to OpenStack contributor was a series of procedural knowledge transfers, wherein the obstacles to learning reduces with each new technology that is learned.

[**Debugging the Virtualization layer (libvirt and QEMU) in OpenStack**, with Kashyap Chamarthy](https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/Presentation/4094)

> Virtualization drivers (e.g. libvirt, QEMU/KVM) are the core part of OpenStack Compute layer. An OpenStack environment is challenging to debug as is -- more so when multiple Compute nodes and thereby multiple libvirt daemons and QEMU instances are involved. A good grasp of Virtualization debugging mechanisms is vital for effective root cause analysis. To that end, libvirt and QEMU provide a rich set of debugging controls that allow us to query (or modify) the state of virtual machines in distress.

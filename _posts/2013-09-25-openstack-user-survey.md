If you haven't already done so, please consider filling out the OpenStack User Survey, at  http://www.openstack.org/user-survey  The survey will close on Monday, September 30th, and is an attempt by the OpenStack Foundation to gather some data on who is using OpenStack, where and how.

If you participated in the survey last year, this is an update to that information, so it's still valuable to fill it out.

Thanks!

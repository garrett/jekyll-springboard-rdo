At the recent OpenStack Summit in Portland, Oregon there were a number of excellent presentations on technologies we ship in RDO.

One of the more exciting ones was this presentation on using Heat to automate application deployment of OpenStack on OpenStack (the TripleO project), by Clint Byrnum from HP.

From the talk description:
> How different are servers from VMs? Do we need special tools to manage servers, or 
> can we adapt a more cloud-like pattern in managing them at scale? Heat has been
> designed to deploy cloud applications on top of OpenStack. But with Nova Baremetal,
> the line blurs between cloud and real server. As part of the OpenStack - on OpenStack,
> or "TripleO"" project, we're excited to use Heat to manage a complete deployment of
> OpenStack. We'll be sharing the various techniques we make use of in Heat to leverage
> its orchestration capabilities in fully automating the deployment and management of
> OpenStack.

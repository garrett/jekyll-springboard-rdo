After a really quiet week last week, we have a lot of great blog posts this week.

**Our cloud in Kilo**, by Tim Bell

> Following on from previous upgrades, CERN migrated the OpenStack cloud to Kilo during September to November. Along with the bug fixes, we are planning on exploiting the significant number of new features, especially as related to performance tuning. The overall cloud architecture was covered at the Tokyo OpenStack summit video https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/videos/presentation/unveiling-cern-cloud-architecture.

**Evolving IT architectures: It can be hard**, by Gordon Haff

> This is the second in a series of posts that delves deeper into the questions that IDC’s Mary Johnston Turner and Gary Chen considered in a recent IDC Analyst Connection. The second question asked: What are the typical challenges that organizations need to address as part of this evolution [to IT that at least includes a strong cloud-native component]?

**How cloud-native needs cultural change**, by Gordon Haff

> This is the third in a series of posts that delves deeper into the questions that IDC’s Mary Johnston Turner and Gary Chen considered in a recent IDC Analyst Connection. The third question asked: How will IT management skills, tools, and processes need to change [with the introduction of cloud-native architectures]?

**Getting Started with Tripleo** by Adam Young

> OpenStack is big. I’ve been focused on my little corner of it, Keystone, for a long time. Now, it is time for me to help out with some of the more downstream aspects of configuring RDO deployments. In order to do so, I need to do an RDO deployment. Until recently, this has meant Packstack. However, Packstack really is not meant for production deployments. RDO manager is the right tool for that. So, I am gearing up on RDO manager. The upstream of RDO Manager is TripleO.

**Testing OpenStack is hard** by David Moreau Simard

> Testing OpenStack is hard
There is currently almost 50 official OpenStack projects
There is over 1000 source and binary packages built and provided by the official RDO repositories
These packages are bundled, integrated or provided by many different installers and vendors
There are countless deployment use cases ranging from simple private clouds to large scale complex and highly available public clouds

**Thinking outside the box and outside the gate to improve OpenStack and RDO** by David Moreau Simard

> I recently explained how testing everything in OpenStack is hard. The reality is that the RDO community has finite resources. Testing everything is not just hard, it’s time consuming and expensive. I’ve been thinking a lot about how to tackle this and experimented around ways to improve our test coverage in this context.

**How to build RedHat 100 node Openstack lab on AWS - Technical write up and talk**

This installation was deployed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (64bit) using the packstack installer. The setup started with one compute, controller and neutron node and was scaled in an automated fashion on AWS to 100 compute nodes, until we hit some interesting issues with some services on controller node. This exercise also describes the scenario of how you can setup Openstack labs(which require KVM) on AWS and Google Cloud with Ravello's nested hypervisor platform with hardware acceleration.

**When**: February 26 6-8pm PST

**Where**: 2479 E Bayshore Road, Suite 188(left entrance to the bldg), Palo Alto, CA

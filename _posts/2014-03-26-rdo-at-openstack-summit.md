The schedule for the OpenStack Summit has been posted - http://openstacksummitmay2014atlanta.sched.org/ - and there's tons of great content from across the OpenStack ecosystem, from dozens of projects. We're particularly exited about the content being presented by RDO engineers, as well as our colleagues that work on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform (RHEL-OSP). Those presentations are listed at http://community.redhat.com/events/#openstacksummitus and you'll probably recognize a number of the names from this forum, the mailing lists, and IRC.

We're really looking forward to Summit. If you're going to be there, please drop by the RDO booth and say hi. We'd like to hear about how you're using OpenStack in your organization.

Register soon - the Early Bird rate ends on Friday!

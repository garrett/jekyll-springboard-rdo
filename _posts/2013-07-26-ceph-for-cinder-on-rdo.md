Our friends in Inktank recently added a new page to the wiki [documenting the process for enabling Ceph for block storage on RDO](http://rdoproject.org/Using_Ceph_for_Block_Storage_with_RDO).

This has been a popular request from RDO users in addition to the documentation and support for [Gluster as a storage back-end](http://www.gluster.org/community/documentation/index.php/GlusterFS_Cinder). Let us know how it works!

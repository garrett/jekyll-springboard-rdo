We're starting another day at OSCon, at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, Oregon. It's been a great week so far, with lots of great conversations with users, and potential users, of RDO.

If you're at the conference, please drop by and say hi. Or follow us on @RDOCommunity for periodic updates through the day.

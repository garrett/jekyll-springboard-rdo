The schedule for RDO Community Day at FOSDEM is now available at [https://www.rdoproject.org/events/rdo-day-fosdem-2016/](https://www.rdoproject.org/events/rdo-day-fosdem-2016/). Exact times are not confirmed, but we should have those in the next few days.

The RDO Community day is colocated with the [CentOS Dojo](https://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Brussels2016), which should also be announcing their schedule in the coming week, featuring a Sysadmin track and a Developer track.

Lunch is provided.

Although attendance is free, you must [register at Eventbright](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/centos-dojo-brussels-belgium-jan-29th-2016-tickets-19589843750) both so that we know how many lunches we need to provide, and also to ensure that the door guards will grant you entrance to the facility when you arrive.

We are excited about this event, and look forward to seeing you there.

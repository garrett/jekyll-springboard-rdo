Here's what RDO enthusiasts have been writing about over the past week.

If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!

**OpenStack’s Volume Backup Status** by Gorka Eguileor

> When working in the Cloud the idea of doing backups like in the old days may seen counter intuitive. After all, the main reasons for having backups are recovering data after it’s lost, by deletion or corruption, and recovering it from an earlier time, and you have those covered with fast volume snapshots and the use of fault tolerant back-ends like Ceph, that replicate data, for your volumes.

**A fresh look for the oVirt Administrator Portal Dashboard** by Liz Blanchard

> In my previous post on OpenStack’s volume backups I gave an overview of Cinder’s Backup service current status and I mentioned that some of the limitations that currently exist could be easily overcome scripting a helper tool.

**OpenStack Networking without DHCP** by Lars Kellogg-Stedman

> In an OpenStack environment, cloud-init generally fetches information from the metadata service provided by Nova. It also has support for reading this information from a configuration drive, which under OpenStack means a virtual CD-ROM device attached to your instance containing the same information that would normally be available via the metadata service.

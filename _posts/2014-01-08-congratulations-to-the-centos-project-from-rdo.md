The RDO Community is thrilled with Red Hat's recent announcement of the closer relationship with CentOS (LINK HERE - http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/01/red-hat-and-centos-join-forces/ ). Congratulations to the CentOS project, and to all the folks who have worked so hard to make this happen.

We've already enjoyed a lot of energy from the Fedora community, in testing RDO, submitting bugs reports and fixes, and participating in the support conversation on IRC and ask.openstack.org.

We're really looking forward to seeing this kind of energy build from the CentOS community as well, and Red Hat's closer relationship with CentOS gives us a better avenue to help make this happen.

In the coming months, we hope to engage more closely with CentOS, providing a Live distro of RDO based on CentOS, CentOS cloud images, and participating in the development of the CentOS Cloud Infrastructure SIG in any way we can. We're really excited about the future with CentOS, especially those of who are already CentOS users!
